      <title>Reasoning about speculative execution attacks</title>

      <description>Speculative execution attacks, like the recent SPECTRE attacks, exploit the persistent microarchitectural side-effects of speculatively executed instructions. These attacks affect all modern general-purpose CPUs and pose a serious threat against platforms with multiple tenants. However, we still lack a precise characterization of security against speculative execution attacks. Such a characterization is a prerequisite for reasoning about the effectiveness and security of countermeasures.
Goals This project&amp;rsquo;s goals are (1) building the theoretical foundations for reasoning about speculative execution attacks, (2) developing techniques for detecting speculative leaks (or prove their absence), and (3) analyzing the security of (hardware and software) SPECTRE&amp;rsquo;s countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Provably secure access and inference control in databases</title>

      <description>Databases often store and manage sensitive data. Regulating the access to databases is, therefore, essential. To this end, researchers have developed both access control and inference control mechanisms. Ideally, all these mechanisms should come with security proofs clearly stating what attacks they are designed to thwart, as with security mechanisms in other domains. Unfortunately, this is far from reality. Existing mechanisms are implemented in an ad hoc fashion, with neither precise security guarantees nor the means to verify them.</description>
