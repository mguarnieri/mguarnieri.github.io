      <description>Speculative execution attacks, like the recent SPECTRE attacks, exploit the persistent micro-architectural side effects of speculatively executed instructions. These attacks affect all modern general-purpose CPUs and pose a serious threat against platforms with multiple tenants. However, we still lack a precise characterization of security against speculative execution attacks. Such a characterization is a prerequisite for reasoning about the effectiveness of countermeasures and for making principled decisions about their placement.</description>
